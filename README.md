# Hello person 👋🤖

🤸‍♂️ As an eager 23 year old, I am learning new about software development and information technology everyday and I am fond of it.

✨ My mindset increating any software is to make it clean and maintainable for fellow developers and future expansion.

🔭 I’m currently working on a startup project at [loopsio](https://loopsio.com/) with other students and the client directly.\
🌱 I’m currently studying at the **University of Strathclyde** in Glasgow, where I am completing my fourth and final year.\
⚡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with the beauty of the result of using type systems properly.
